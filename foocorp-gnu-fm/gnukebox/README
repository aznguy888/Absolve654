This is the GNU FM server, compatible with the last.fm API.

To install visit http://yourserver.com/install.php

As things stand you'll need the ADODB module installed.

Web services API:

To test the authentication API once the server is set up:

  1. Navigate to /2.0/?method=auth.gettoken&api_key=01234567890123456789012345678901&api_sig=01234567890123456789012345678901
     (The api_key and api_sig are only checked to be 32 characters long since Last.FM shared secrets cannot be checked)

  2. Copy the key that is returned by the auth.gettoken method

  3. Navigate to /api/auth/?api_key=01234567890123456789012345678901&token=<copied token>
     (Inserting the copied token into the noted place)

  4. Login as testuser/password (this user is hard-coded upon database setup)

  5. Close the browser when requested

  6. Navigate to /2.0/?method=auth.getsession&api_key=01234567890123456789012345678901&api_sig=01234567890123456789012345678901&token=<copied token>
     (Once again substituting the old copied token into the noted place)

  7. The 32-byte key returned between the <key> tags in this response will be used in the Submissions protocol handshake

Submissions API:

 The submissions API (http://www.last.fm/api/submissions) is used by clients for scrobbling tracks, authentication can either be carried out with a token from the web services API or via a token created by "md5(md5(password) + timestamp)"

 To test standard authentication:

 1. Visit /?hs=true&p=1.2&u=testuser&t=1238855138&a=a40dfdc5aa3012c64425a5953267b232&c=tst

 2. You should receive "OK" (followed by a session id, and the URL for the now playing and submissions servers).
