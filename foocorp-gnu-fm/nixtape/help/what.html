<h1>What is Libre.fm?</h1>

<p>Libre.fm is a website that allows you to share your listening
habits and discover new music.</p>

<h2>Share your listening habits</h2>

<p>To get started with Libre.fm, you install a small piece of software
on your computer, which sends the title, artist and album of every
song you listen to, to the Libre.fm website. We log this information
against your unique profile page, where yourself and other users of
the site can see which bands you listen to, and which songs you
like. This is known to many people as <em>scrobbling</em>.</p>

<p><strong>Many players already contain this software, but if you use
Windows or Mac OS X you may have to download something to get
started.</strong></p>

<p>You may already have a piece of software that can do this for you,
but it may be for <strong>Last.fm</strong>, a site similar to
Libre.fm, but run by CBS. It is usually possible with these programs
to simply tell your computer to send things to our website, instead of
Last.fm. We have full instructions on how to do this, to help you get
started as quickly as possible.</p>

<h2>Discover new music</h2>

<p>At Libre.fm, we're constantly on the search for new artists
releasing libre music. Libre music is music which allows you as a fan
of the artist to download the music, share it and even incorporate it
into your own videos, mix CDs and other creative works, legally. The
artists who make these songs <strong>want</strong> you to do this with
their work, and license it to the general public under a mechanism we
call <strong>copyleft</strong>. Copyleft is very similar to copyright,
but instead of the usual list of things you're not allowed to do,
copyleft musicians flip things around, and let you do a wide range of
exciting and interesting things with their music. If you enjoy their
music, please consider helping the artist by buying downloads, CDs and
merchandise from their website, or going to see them live. For many
musicians, money made from gigs is a significant portion of their
income.</p>
